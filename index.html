            <h2>Who they are</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Doctors Without Borders, French Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), international humanitarian group
            dedicated to providing medical care to people in distress, including victims of political violence and
            natural disasters. The populations the group assists typically lack access to or adequate resources for
            medical treatment. The group was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for Peace.
            Doctors Without Borders was founded in 1971 by 13 physicians and journalists who were dissatisfied with
            the neutrality of the Red Cross. The founding members believed that people in distress had the right to
            medical intervention and that the need to provide assistance to those people transcended national borders.
            They also felt that they had a duty to speak out about injustice, even though it might offend host
            governments.</p>

            <h2>What they do</h2>
          </div>
          <p>In 1972 Doctors Without Borders conducted its first major relief effort, helping victims of an earthquake
            in Nicaragua. Other significant missions followed, including the provision of care for victims of fighting
            in Lebanon (1976), Afghanistan (1980), and the Russian republic of Chechnya (1995). Doctors Without Borders
            has continued to work to relieve famine, to offer medical care to casualties of war, and to assist refugees
            in many countries throughout the world. In 2003 Doctors Without Borders was a founding partner in the
            organization Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), which works to create medicines for diseases
            such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. The group has played an important role in caring for the
            victims of disease outbreaks.</p>
